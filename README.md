## Course Description

In this project-based course, you'll learn about mobile manipulation through hands-on experience working with real mobile manipulators. You'll gain experience with teleoperation, autonomy, perception, navigation, manipulation, and human-robot interaction, all within the context of mobile manipulators. You'll also learn about robot design, collaborative research, and applications for mobile manipulators.

This is a graduate-level project-based course for students interested in mobile manipulation. There are no exams nor textbook assignments. You will be working with a group of your peers to develop solutions to real-world problems through the control of a mobile manipulator. There are two projects where you will work with **_real mobile manipulators_** and build on state-of-the-art methods from scientific literature, all leading to a video recording, live robot demonstration, presentation, and short paper to disseminate your results.

### Pre-Requisites
Prior experience with the Python programming language is encouraged and extremely beneficial.

## History and Example Projects

This course has been developed and inspired based on a prior project-based course on mobile manipulation for robotic caregiving, taught at CMU and Georgia Tech.

Examples of past mobile manipulation projects can be found on the following course webpage: [16-887: Robotic Caregivers and Intelligent Physical Collaboration](https://zackory.com/rc2023/)

## Credit

Earlier versions of this course were co-developed and co-instructed with [Prof. Charlie Kemp](https://charliekemp.com) at Georgia Tech. Early versions at Georgia Tech emphasized robotic caregiving through mobile manipulation: [Robotic Caregivers](https://sites.gatech.edu/robotic-caregivers/).
